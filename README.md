# XSite

XSite is a web-based estate management platform that allows admins to manage estates, properties, and related operations through a centralized dashboard. The platform also supports user profiles for accessing estate-related information.

Although XSite includes a mobile application, this repository is primarily focused on the **website**, which serves as the core management and administration system.
